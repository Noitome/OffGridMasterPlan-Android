# Content Strategy: Off-Grid Master Plan

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the content strategy for the Off-Grid Master Plan hub. The goal is to provide high-value, actionable technical information to DIY enthusiasts and those seeking energy independence. The content will be authoritative yet accessible, with a subtle Australian identity.

## 2. Target Audience
*   **The Practical DIYer:** Loves building things, values ROI and durability. Wants "how-to" guides, not just theory.
*   **The Modern Prepper:** Concerned about grid instability but wants sustainable, long-term solutions, not just stockpiles.
*   **The Eco-conscious Homeowner:** Wants to reduce their footprint and bills.

## 3. Tone & Voice Guidelines
*   **Professional yet Approachable:** authoritative technical advice delivered like a helpful mate.
*   **Subtle Aussie Flavor:** Use local spelling (colour, organise) and occasional phrases ("fair dinkum," "no worries," "sorted") but avoid caricature.
*   **Action-Oriented:** Focus on "doing" rather than just "reading."
*   **Format:** Clear headings, bullet points, and data tables (Matrices) for easy scanning.

## 4. Topic Roadmap (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Core Systems (The "Big Three")
1.  **The Off-Grid Tech Matrix:** A high-level comparison of all available technologies (Water, Energy, Waste) scored by ROI and DIY difficulty.
    *   *Status:* **In Production** (`/resources/tech-matrix`)
2.  **Water Security Deep Dive:** Rainwater harvesting vs. Atmospheric Water Generators (AWG) vs. Bore water.
3.  **Solar vs. Wind:** When to use which? A realistic look at wind turbine efficiency in low-wind areas.

### Phase 2: Optimization & Lifestyle
4.  **AI Insights on Off-Grid Living:** Emerging trends like "Symbiotic Tech" and waste-to-energy systems.
    *   *Status:* **In Production** (`/resources/ai-insights`)
5.  **Waste Management:** Composting toilets (Berkey/Nature's Head) and biogas digesters.
6.  **Heating & Cooling:** Passive solar design principles for the Australian climate.

### Phase 3: Advanced & Niche
7.  **Upcycling for Energy:** Repurposing EV batteries (e.g., Nissan Leaf) for home storage.
8.  **Plastic Pyrolysis:** Converting waste plastic into fuel (safety & feasibility).
9.  **Community Microgrids:** Sharing power with neighbours.

## 5. SEO & Distribution Strategy
*   **Keywords:** "DIY off grid solar," "rainwater harvesting Australia," "off grid toilet reviews," "best solar batteries 2025."
*   **Internal Linking:** Connect every "Guide" page (Solar, Wind) to the central **Tech Matrix**.
*   **External:** Leverage Pinterest for diagram sharing and Reddit (r/offgrid) for discussion.

## 6. Success Metrics
*   **Engagement:** Time on page > 3 minutes.
*   **Conversion:** Clicks to affiliate products (Amazon, Victron).
*   **Retention:** Return visitors checking for new matrix updates.
